# Array permutation
Write a program that takes two integer array elements (one input per line) and gives output YES, if there's a permutation of the first array that is equal to the second array or gives output NO, if there's no such permutation.

## Case 1
For input provided as follows:

```
1 2 5 3 7 0 7 3 5 2 1
7 3 1 2 5 0 5 2 1 3 7
```

Output of the program will be: **YES**

Description: _We can check that the first array can be changed to the following array:_
```
7 3 1 2 5 0 5 2 1 3 7
```
_So that makes the first array a permutation of the second array, giving answer YES._

## Case 2
For the input provided as follows:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
6 5 4 3 2 0 11 10 9 8 7
```

Output of the program will be: **NO**

Description: _The first array can not be a permutation of the second array since the first array doesn't have the number 0 that is present on the second array._
