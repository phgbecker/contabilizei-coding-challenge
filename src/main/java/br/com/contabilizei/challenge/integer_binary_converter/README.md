Write a program that takes one integer A as input. Your program should output the number of 1s in the binary representation of the inputted number.
Note: The integer A will be given in the first line of the input.

## Case 1

For the input provided as follows:
```
10
```
Output of the program will be: **2**


Description: _The binary representation of 10 is 1010, so it has exactly two 1s._


## Case 2

For the input provided as follows:
```
2
```

Output of the program will be: **1**

Description: _The binary representation of 2 is 10, so it has only one 1._
