# MaxAbsoluteDifferrence
Write a program that takes an integer N and an array of N integers as input. Your program should output the maximum absolute difference between two elements from the array.
Note: The integer N will be given in the first line and the array of N integers will be given in the second line (each integer separated by a single space).

## Case 1:

For the input provided as follows:
```
3
1 2 3
```

Output of the program will be: **2**

Description: _The maximum absolute difference we can get is with 1 and 3, giving us 3 â€“ 1= 2._


## Case 2:

For the input provided as follows:
```
4
1 1 1 1
```

Output of the program will be: **0**

Description: _The maximum we can get is 0 by getting any pair of 1s._
